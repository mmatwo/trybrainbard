                        <p>We hear you! And yes, it really does. Think of it like exercise – consistent, focused practice builds strength. Brain Bard provides that targeted practice for your mental math muscles, especially for the quick calculation and estimation skills you use every day. It's not magic, it takes a little effort, but the app gives you the tools and feedback to see real improvement in your speed, accuracy, and confidence with numbers.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Brain Bard is honestly for pretty much anyone who wants to feel more comfortable and quicker with everyday math! Whether you're a student wanting to solidify basics, an adult who feels a bit rusty, or someone who just wants to rely less on a calculator for daily tasks (like budgeting or shopping), Brain Bard can help. You control the difficulty, so you can start wherever you're comfortable and grow from there.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>We focus on the essentials you use most often: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (×), and division (÷). You get to choose which ones you practice and how tricky the numbers get (from simple single digits like 5x7 up to larger numbers like 123x456). The goal is practical skill, not super complex theoretical math.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Great question! We purposefully skipped the distracting mini-games you might find elsewhere. Brain Bard is focused, targeted training. Think of it more like a clean, efficient gym for your brain rather than an arcade. The "fun" comes from seeing yourself get faster and more accurate, and feeling that growing confidence!</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Two big things! First, our <strong>strong focus on practical, everyday math skills</strong>, including our unique <strong>Estimation Mode</strong>. This mode specifically helps you get better at <em>estimating</em> – which is super useful in real life when you don't need an exact answer right away. Second, we offer a <strong>clean, no-fluff experience</strong> focused purely on helping you improve efficiently.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <button class="faq-question">What's this "Estimation Mode" all about? Sounds tricky!</button>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Not tricky, just super useful! It's designed for situations where getting <em>close</em> to the right answer quickly is more important than getting the <em>exact</em> answer. Think estimating a grocery bill or figuring out roughly how long a trip will take. You make your best guess, and the app tells you how close you were. It's a fantastic way to build real-world number sense.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>That's totally up to you! Even just 5-10 minutes of focused practice regularly can make a difference. The Practice mode has no time limits, and you can set the duration for Sprint mode. Fit it in whenever you have a few moments – waiting in line, during a commute, or just taking a quick brain break.</p>

                        <p>You'll definitely feel it as calculations become easier! Plus, the app includes a <strong>Log</strong> section that tracks your performance over time. You can see your stats organized by difficulty level (we call them Tiers), giving you clear proof of how much faster and more accurate you're becoming.</p>
